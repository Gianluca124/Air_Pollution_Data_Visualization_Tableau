Has air quality improved in the last 15 years in and around Milan? Is the concentration of pollutants higher in winter or summer? And why? What are the main pollutants and what are the meteorological and anthropogenic factors that influence the seasonal trend of concentrations?

We tried to answer these and other questions by analyzing the data of ARPA Lombardia. The results of our analysis were then displayed in an interactive infographic created using the Tableau platform.
